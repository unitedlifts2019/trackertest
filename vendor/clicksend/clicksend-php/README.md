How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a PHP library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a composer dependency in the generated composer.json
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

	1. Go to sdk project root folder.
	2. Use composer to install the dependencies. If you don't have composer you can download it on https://getcomposer.org/download
	3. Enter command `composer update` to install dependencies.
